          Y STEM and Chess works with schools with a large percentage of
          students qualifying for free or reduced-cost lunch programs or those
          that focus on the "at-risk" student population. These students are the
          "outliers" of our traditional education system, both socially and
          economically. Students in this group are often rebellious, not because
          they are unable to learn but because they respond differently to
          different learning approaches. The schools understand this, and that
          is why they are looking for alternative solutions to fulfill the needs
          of their "at-risk" students. Y STEM and Chess aim to be that
          alternative educational approach.

          Our goal is to use the Mastery Learning Model to provide at-risk and
          underserved children with the skills, knowledge, and opportunity to
          enter STEM career paths and to assist in solving the critical shortage
          of STEM-skilled citizens that exists today.

          experience, we need YOU to help.
