          Y STEM and Chess Inc. (YSC) is focused on resolving two current social
          problems by providing a unique twenty-first century methodology to
          learning called “Mastery Learning.” First, YSC is focused on our
          society’s unfulfilled need for students with a firm learning
          foundation to pursue a life in the world of STEM. YSC seeks to
          encourage STEM careers for all in our younger generations. Second, and
          most importantly, YSC is focused on providing a solid educational
          foundation for the children of our socially and economically
          underserved populations, and to introduce and engage them in the world
          of STEM.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is to use the Mastery Learning Model to provide at-risk and
          underserved children with the skills, knowledge, and opportunity to
          enter STEM career paths and to assist in solving the critical shortage
          of STEM-skilled citizens that exists today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Mastery Learning provides each student with a unique learning
          experience, we need YOU to help.

          Y STEM and Chess works with schools with a large percentage of
          students qualifying for free or reduced-cost lunch programs or that
          focus on the “at-risk” student population. These students are the
          “outliers” of our traditional education system both socially and
          economically. Students of this group are often rebellious, not because
          they are unable to learn, but because they respond to different
          learning approaches. The schools understand this, and that is why they
          are looking for alternative solutions to fulfill the needs of their
          “at risk” students. Y STEM and Chess seeks to be that alternative
          approach to education.
