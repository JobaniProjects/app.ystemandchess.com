                <p>
                    Impoverished children benefit greatly from high paying STEM jobs.
                    Chess allows them to develop the analytical and critical thinking skills 
                    to perform these jobs and grant them an opportunity to fulfill their dreams.
                    Through our program, we will also teach them essential skills applicable 
                    to all industries like coding, algebra, engineering, and the sciences.

          Y STEM and Chess Inc. (YSC) is focused on resolving two current social
          problems by providing a unique twenty-first century methodology to
          learning called “Mastery Learning.” First, YSC is focused on our
          society’s unfulfilled need for students with a firm learning
          foundation to pursue a life in the world of STEM. YSC seeks to
          encourage STEM careers for all in our younger generations. Second, and
          most importantly, YSC is focused on providing a solid educational
          foundation for the children of our socially and economically
          underserved populations, and to introduce and engage them in the world
          of STEM.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is to use the Mastery Learning Model to provide at-risk and
          underserved children with the skills, knowledge, and opportunity to
          enter STEM career paths and to assist in solving the critical shortage
          of STEM-skilled citizens that exists today.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Since Mastery Learning provides each student with a unique learning
          experience, we need YOU to help.
