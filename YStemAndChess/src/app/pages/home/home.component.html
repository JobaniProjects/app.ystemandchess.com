                <p>
                    Impoverished children benefit greatly from high paying STEM jobs.
                    Chess allows them to develop the analytical and critical thinking skills 
                    to perform these jobs and grant them an opportunity to fulfill their dreams.
                    Through our program, we will also teach them essential skills applicable 
                    to all industries like coding, algebra, engineering, and the sciences.
